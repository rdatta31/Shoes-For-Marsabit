	<h1> Sustainable Footwear for Tribes in Marsabit, Kenya </h1><br><br>
			<h2> Overview</h2>
	
	<p> The town of Marsabit is an outpost of urban civilization in the vast desert of northern Kenya. <i>Jiggers</i> infestation is a major health issue endangering tribal societies in East Africa. <i>Jiggers</i>  are a small flea-like insect that burrows into the skin of fingers and toes and eats away the flesh. Over 1.8 million children are said to be affected by <i>Jiggers</i> in Kenya.</p>

	

		<p> The objective of this project was to develop a sustainable approach to solving the <i>Jigger</i> problem. More specifically, the goal was to design economic and easily accessible footwear, and a sustainable manufacturing process which the tribes could employ.<p>

			<p> The project was completed in partnership with Partners for Care, and Dr. Joyelle Harris, Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><br>

	<h2> Proposed Solutions </h2>

		<p> An important aspect of the project was to leverage existing skills within the tribe. The proposed soulution was footwear designed using locally available materials, which could be sewed and knitted by the tribes using existing skills and materials. </p><br>

		<h3> <b>Materials Used</b> </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Fabric </li>
				<li> Natural Fibres e.g. Corn Husk </li>
				<li> Recyclable Plastic </li>
				<li> Sewing Materials </li>
			</ul>
	
			<p> <i> Total Cost </i> ~ $0.50 per pair </p><br>


			<h2> Performance & User Testing </h2>
			<p> The product was field tested by users in Marsabit, Kenya. Overall, the product recieved positive reviews with users citing features such as comfort and protection as key factors. The product was economic, easy to make, and the materials needed were easily accessible. Areas of improvement included durability of the shoe over rocky terrain, and protection from dust in the desert environment. Future steps include reinforcing the base and sole of the shoe, with multiple layers of plastic, or similar rigid materials. In addition, the use of thicker fabric (such as denim) could possibly add to the structural durability, and attract less dust in outdoor environments.</p>
